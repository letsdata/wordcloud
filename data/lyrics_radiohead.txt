There's a little child
Running round this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast
Grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done
How did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Somethings will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Drift all you like
From ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
Drunken confessions
And hijacked affairs
Just make you more alone

If you come home I'll bake you a cake
Made of velvet eyes
I wish you could see me
Just when I kill
You're my man-o-war
You're my man-o-war

And the worms will eat you whole
My love

So unplug your phone
Stop all the chatter
Iit all comes flooding back
From poisoned clouds
To poison the world
You're my man-o-war
You're my man-o-war

And the worms will eat you whole
And the worms will eat you whole
My love
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint your house white and feel the noise
But there'll be something missing

And now that you found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
I'm not afraid

She stands stark naked and she beckons you to bed
Don't go you'll only want to come back again

So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking

And now that you found it, it's gone
And now that you feel it, you don't
I'm not afraid

Alternate lyrics for the first line of the second verse:
she kisses you with tongue and pulls you to the bed
don't go you'll only want to come back again
I jumped in the river and what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
All the things I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the things I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt (x2)
I see you in the dark
Falling down the fastlane
Coming out to me

Warm lights belong to me
Crawling out to me
Crawling out to me

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Even when you're coming down
You are standing for the world
And I can see you now
And I'm being there, to come down

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around..
I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn
I saw a light coming on

I used to think
I used to think
There is no future left at all
I used to think

Start again begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all

What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?

Start again begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
I won't run away no more, I promise
Even when I get bored, I promise
Even when you lock me out, I promise
I say my prayers every night, I promise
I don't wish that I'm strict, I promise
The tantrums and the chilling chats, I promise
Even when the ship is wrecked, I promise
Tie me to the rotten deck, I promise
I won't fool around no more, I promise
Even when I get bored, I promise
Even when you lock me out, I promise
I say my prayers every night, I promise
I won't fool around no more, I promise
I want you to know
He's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste

So knives out
Cook him up
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth

If you'd been a dog
They would have drowned you at birth

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth

I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
This is the place
Sit down, you're safe now
You've been stuck in a lift
We've been trying to reach you, Thom

This is the place
It won't hurt, it will not hurt

A smell of recognition
A face you barely loved
Empty all your pockets
'Cause it's time to go home

This is the place
Remembering all the things you always see

You've been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale
At the bottom of the ocean

A smell of recognition
A face you barely loved
Empty all your pockets
'Cause it's time to go home

Today is the first day of the rest of your days
So lighten up, squirt
Once again, she is smashing up her house again
She is throwing things through windows
She is mad at someone else again,
It is now a broken home

Once again, I am so low with my only friend
He is smashing up his house again
You are throwing things at me again
And I'm wrecked up all inside

Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Well if I stop that singing to you friend
Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Someone is standing there

There I'm home, once the feet inside shout it out
Once a beating when I make my way out
Once a beating when I'm home inside
There is nothing wrong at all

Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Well if I stop that singing to you friend
Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Someone is standing there
I'll drown my beliefs
To have you be in peace
I'll dress like your niece
To wash your swollen feet

Just don't leave, don't leave

And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love wins
On lollipops and crisps

Just don't leave, don't leave

I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kiss and smile

Just lonely, lonely..
Just lonely, lonely..
come to me for I am a wicked child
????
I am a wicked child
I am a wicked child
I am the devil's son and I wish I could be good
keep you satisfied
I wish I could be good
I wish I could be good
come to me for I am a wicked child
????
I am a wicked child
I am a wicked child
I am a wicked child
I want to be dead (?)
I want to be dead (?)
Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Call your own empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us all on
You can take us all on

You and whose army?
You and your cronies

You think it's so easy
We want to know
We want to know
I'm so sad
I'm so sad
I'm so sad..

Destiny, hold my hand protect me from the world
Here we are with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

And if the world does turn
And if London burns I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar
And they won't be anything anymore

Grow my hair, grow my hair
I am Jim Morrison
Grow my hair
I wanna be wanna be wanna be Jim Morrison

Here we are with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere
And if the world does turn
And if London burns I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar
And they won't be anything anymore
In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel

And everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)
(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)
(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone

I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack out

And everything I touch turns to stone
Everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)
(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice when I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell I'm doing here
I don't belong here

She's running out again
She's running out
She runs runs runs

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong
He wants us to listen, he wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak

But how do you
How do you
How do you

He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget
And he's just like his daddy because he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies anyway that he can

But how do you
How do you
How do you
Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down

Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't

So many things that keep,  that keep me underground
So many words that I, that I can never find
If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before

And even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't

If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before
And even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
I feel better, I feel better now you've gone
I feel better, I feel strong

I got better, I got better now there's nothing wrong
I got better, I got better, I got strong

Tell me something, tell me something I don't know
Tell me one thing, tell me one thing and let it go

I got something, I got something heaven knows
I got something, I got something I don't know
I can't afford to breathe in this time
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
Hooked back up to the cathode ray
I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

I wanna breathe, I wanna grow
I'd say I want it but I don't know how
I work, I bleed, I beg and I pray
But I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead
I'm better off

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

Why
Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed
You're free until you drop
You're free until you've had enough
But you don't understand
You've no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

Aeroplane
Do I mean what I mean
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane
A thousand miles an hour
And politics in power
That you don't understand
You've no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord

The answer to your prayers
We'll drop you anywhere
With no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord, no ripcord
And the wise man say I don't want to hear your voice
And the thin man say I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

And the mother say we spit on your son some more
And the buildings say we spit on your face some more
And the feeling is that there's something wrong
Because I can't find the words and I can't find the songs

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is

It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway
Been thinking about you, your record's a hit
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
But I'm still no-one, and you're not a star
What do you care

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself, and what do you care
When the other men are far, far better

All the things you got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes and bribed the company
To come and see you, honey

I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
But they don't know what I know, and why should you care
When I'm not there

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself, what do you care
When I'm not there

All the things you got, you'll never need
All the things you got, I'm planning to please you, please you

Been thinking about you...
I never wanted anything but this
I tried hard, worked hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died hard

Everytime you're running over me
Everytime you're running I can see

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feels me
I will not control myself

I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate
And I burn all hate

Everytime you're running out on me
Everytime you're running I can see

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feels me
I will not control myself

The waters break, the waters run all over me
The waters break, the waters run
And this time you're gonna pay

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feels me
I will not control myself..
You are the sun and moon and stars, are you
And I could never run away from you

You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you

It's like the world is going to end so soon
And why should I believe myself

You, me and everything caught in the fire
I can see me drowning, caught in the fire

The earlier version finishes with the following:
Hey the sun and moon and stars are yeah..
But I won't share myself with you
You to me
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special
But I 'm a creep
I 'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here

She's running out again
She's running out
She run, run, run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here.
Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of fear is thicker than you think
Don't do it
Don't jump

Changed shape to fit
In the end you just feel sick
A million love songs under anaesthetic
Hey don't do it
Don't jump

Lewis
Save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
It never really mattered

We never noticed
We never understood
He just get crushed to fit
He never even smelt out the best
It's the best
It's the best day of your life

Lewis
Save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
It never really mattered
No
I swear
I swear
I swear

Oh
Mistreated
A low corporate
Mistreated
A low corporate

I don't wanna to talk about it
I don't wanna to talk about it
I don't wanna to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I don't wanna to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I am gone
Everybody's raging
And these fruits
They still taste of poison
I won't be around
When you really need me

I can't sleep
Why can't someone hold me
I need warmth
A restless body cracks some more
I won't have the strength
When you really need me
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it
But it hurts like hell

My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support
My iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep
To cynical to speak
We are losing it
Can't you tell

We scratch our eternal itch
A twentieth century bitch
And we are grateful for
Our iron lung

The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out
We'll just hum

This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's OK
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's OK

The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The easiest way to sleep at night
Is to carry on believing that I don't exist
The easiest way to sell your soul
is to carry on believing we don't exist
It must be hard
With your head on backwards
I wrapped you inside my coat 
When they came to firebomb the house 
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no-one can touch me 
Now that I'm held in your spell 

A beautiful girl 
A beautiful girl 
Can turn your world into dust 

Sell me a car that goes 
Sell me a house that stands 
I never cared before, I never cared before 
I never cared before, before, before, before 

A beautiful girl 
A beautiful girl 
Can turn your world into dust 

A beautiful girl 
A beautiful girl 
Can turn your world into dust 

I stood in front of her face 
When the first bullet was shot
Rust in the mountains
Rust in the brain
The air is sacred here
In spite of your claim

Up on the the rooftops
Out of reach
Trickster is meaningless
Trickster is weak

He's talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway

I wanted you so bad
That I couldn't say
These things fall apart

We wanted out so bad
That we couldn't say
All things fall apart

We're talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway

Truant kids
A can of brick dust worms
Who do not want to climb down from
Their chestnut tree

Talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
I must get out once in a while
Everything is starting to die
The dust settles
The worms dig
Spiders crawl over the bed

I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now I'm fat
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plates
You never wash up after yourself
They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy

Nice dream, nice dream, nice dream

I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her ansaphone
She says she would love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all

Nice dream [x7]

If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough
If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough

Nice dream [x4]
I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well what am I to do
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you
What are we coming to
What are we gonna do

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home

The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to
I just don't know anymore

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home

I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
What am I coming to
I'm gonna melt down

Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
This is killing me
This is killing me
I don't want to be crippled cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozak painkillers

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
And I used to fly like peter pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Tearing up inside of me
Every day every hour
I wish that I was bullet proof

Wax me
Mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it was bullet proof

So pay the money and take a shot
Leadfill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bullet proof

And bullet proof
And bullet proof
And bullet proof
Her green plastic watering can
For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

If I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted all the time
Her green plastic watering can
For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

If I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted all the time
Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy
Flying on your motorcycle,
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition,
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror,
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation,
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces,
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you,
You will be the one screaming out

Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

It's the best thing that you ever had,
The best thing that you ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had,
The best thing you ever had has gone away
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself
Just you and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the 15th floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day I'll get you
And teach you how to get to purest hell

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself
Just you, you and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself
Just you, you and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself.. yourself.. yourself..
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it
But it hurts like hell

My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support
My iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep
To cynical to speak
We are losing it
Can't you tell?

We scratch our eternal itch
A twentieth century bitch
And we are grateful for
Our iron lung

The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out
We'll just hum

This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's OK
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's OK

The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it
But it hurts like hell

My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support
My iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep

Can't you tell

We scratch our eternal itch

The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy

Nice dream, nice dream, nice dream

I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her ansaphone
She says she would love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all

Nice dream [x7]

If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough
If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough

Nice dream [x4]
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home saying
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
But still...
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken

Why can't you forget
Why can't you forget
Why can't you forget
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again

Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out again

Immerse your soul in love
IMMERSE YOUR SOUL IN LOVE
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again

Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out again

Immerse your soul in love
IMMERSE YOUR SOUL IN LOVE
You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
You just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl
You are so pretty when you're on your knees
Disinfected, eager to please

Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

Each time it comes it eats me alive
I try to behave but it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away

Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
Where do we go from here
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now, when I need you
Alone on an aeroplane
Fall asleep on against the window pane
My blood will thicken

I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
But who are my real friends
Have they all got the bends
Am I really sinking this low

My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends, no, no, no

Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

Where do we go from here
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you
They brought in the CIA, the tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away, to blow me sky high

My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race, race, race, race

Where do we go from here
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you
In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut 
I am born again 

In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In a deep deep sleep of the innocent
I am born again

In a fast german car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection

It's always best when the light is off
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die

And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind

So lock the kids up safe tonight
Put the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

That either way he turns
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there

Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
I will stop
I will stop at nothing
Say the right things
When electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote

When I go forwards you go backwards and somewhere we will meet

Riot shields
Voodoo economics
It's just business
Cattle prods and the IMF
I trust I can rely on your vote

When I go forwards you go backwards and somewhere we will meet
Wake.. from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape

Pack.. and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

Sing.. us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill, such a chill

You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace

We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
Wake.. from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape

Pack.. and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

Sing.. us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill, such a chill

You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace

We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
Wake.. from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape

Pack.. and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

Sing.. us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill, such a chill

You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace

We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke

Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio

Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is
Making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party

This is what you get

Phew, for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself

Karma police arrest this girl
She stares at me
As if she owns the world and
We have crashed her party

He's like a detuned radio

Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so so disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day I'm going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and ...

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Let down again
Let down again
Let down again

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
And one day....
I am going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and...

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
I'm on a roll, I'm on a roll
This time, I feel my luck could change
Kill me Sarah, kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge

The Head of State has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change

Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal

You look so tired and unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

This is my final fit, my final bellyache with

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please

Such a pretty house, such a pretty garden

No alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises (let me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises please (let me out of here)
Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head

The breath of the morning
I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air

I live in a town
Where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet
For cracks in the pavement

Up above
Aliens hover
Making home movies
For the folks back home

Of all these weird creatures
Who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves
And live for their secrets

They're all uptight
Uptight.. [x7]

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends
But they'd never believe
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely

I'd show them the stars
And the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be all right
All right..

I'm just uptight
Uptight.. [x7]

Uptight.. (x7)

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends
But they'd never believe
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely

I'd show them the stars
And the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be all right
All right..

I'm just uptight
Uptight.. (x7)
It barks at no one else but me
Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it seen the sparks a-flowing
No one else would know

Hey man slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down

Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
You ask me where the hell I'm going
At a thousand feet per second

Hey man slow down, slow down
Idiot slow down, slow down

Hey man slow down, slow down
Idiot slow down, slow down
Kid A, Kid A, Kid A, Kid A
Everything, everything, everything, everything..

Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

Everything, everything, everything..
In its right place

Right place

There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What is that you tried to say
What was that you tried to say
Tried to say.. tried to say..
Tried to say.. tried to say..

Everything in its right place
That there, that's not me
I go where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here

In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here

Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes

I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here....
Who's in bunker, who's in bunker
Women and children first
Women and children first
Women and children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I swallow till I burst
Until I burst
Until I..

Who's in bunker, who's in bunker
I've seen too much
I haven't seen enough
You haven't seen enough
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first
And children first
And children..

Here I'm alive, everything all of the time
Here I'm alive, everything all of the time

Ice age coming, ice age coming
Let me hear both sides
Let me hear both sides
Let me hear both..

Ice age coming, ice age coming
Throw me in the fire
Throw me in the fire
Throw me in the..

We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening

Mobiles working
Mobiles chirping
Take the money and run
Take the money and run
Take the money..

Here I'm alive, everything all of the time
Background:
The first of the children
I'm the first in the Irish Sea
Another message I can't read

I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down

You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world

I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way

You're living in a fantasy world [x3]
This beautiful world I'm the first in the Irish Sea
Another message I can't read
I slipped away
I slipped on a little white lie

We got heads on sticks
You got ventriloquists
We got heads on sticks
You got ventriloquists

Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed [x4]

Rats and children follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on kids...
Morning bell
Morning bell
Light another candle
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Coming down the chimney

Run around around around around around....

The lights are on but nobody's home
Everybody wants to be a

Nobody wants to be a slave

Everybody wants to be a
Everyone wants to be a friend
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walking walking walking walking...
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

I will see you in the next life

[Early version has a second verse:]

Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I can't even recognize you

I think you're crazy, maybe [x6]

I will see you in the next life
Flies are buzzing around my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem give me some

You can try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one dropped a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm

If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

I'd really like to help you man
I'd really like to help you man.....
Nervous messed up marionette
Floating around on a prison ship

If you try the best you can

The best you can is good enough

Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
What's going on
What's going on

Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

It's holding on [x3]
If I get old
I will not give in
But if I do
Remind me of this

Remind me that
Once I was free
Once I was cool
Once I was me

And if I sat down and crossed my arms
Hold me until this song

Knock me out
Smash out my brains
If I take the chair and start to talk shit

If I get old remind me of this
That night we kissed and I really meant it
Whatever happens if we're still speaking
Pick up the phone
Play me this song

Oh Banana co.
We really love you and we need you
And oh banana co.
We'd really love to believe you

But everything's underground
We gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah yeah

Oh she said "No go"
She said she'd like to
She's seen you
But no, no go
She knows if you die then we all do

And everything's underground
We've gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah yeah
Everything's burning down
We gotta put it out somehow
Yeah yeah
Dressed in Bishop's robes
Terrifies me still
In bishop's robes
Bastard headmaster

I'm not going back
I'm not going back
I'm not going back

Children taught to kill
To tear themselves to bits
On playing fields
Dressed in bishop's robes

I'm not going back
I'm not going back
I'm not going back
Easy living, easy hold
Easy teething, easy fold
Easy listening, easy love
Easy answers to easy questions
Easy tumble, easy doll
Easy rumble, easy fall
I get up on easy love
I get up on easy questions
There are things to talk about 
Be constructive 

There are weapons, we can use 
Be constructive 
With your blues 

Even when they tore the wall down 
Even when they tore the wall down 

Why don't you quiet down 
Why won't you quiet down 
Why don't you quiet down 
Why won't you quiet down 

We are the dollar and cents
I've had these jeans since I was born
And now they're ripped and now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards

I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But Mum and Dad will not give in

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

And now I know just what it is
It's got disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide

Too scared to talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye bye

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in...
Seen all the good things and bad
Running down the hill
All so battered and brought to the ground
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends

And when I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing
How can you be sure
How can you be sure

If you walk out the door
Will I see you again
If so much of me lies in your eyes
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends

When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, singing
How can you be sure I don't want you
How can you be sure I don't want you
How can you be sure I don't want you
How can you be sure I don't want you

I don't want you, I don't want you anymore
I don't want you, I don't want you anymore
I was stronger
I was better
Picked you out
Now don't say a word
No don't yell out
Never mind
Let you out
Led you back
Stay on
Sit down
Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall
Let it fall
I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn
I saw a light coming on

I used to think
I used to think
There is no future left at all
I used to think

Open up, begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times
And never look back
Never look back

What would I do
What would I do
If I did not have you

Open up, let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Did it all for you to say
You never wanted me that way
Now the dogs have had their meat
I think I'll go plug in the mains

I tumble like a clown
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself into your hands

When you spare a make up smile
I'm instantly your biggest fan
How was I to know that you practiced it beforehand

I tumble like a clown
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself into your hands
What do you want from me now you got me
Now my fingers bleed now they stare at me
I'm a coward now
I hold my peace

Now you tie me up to your feather bed
And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn
You won't let go
You won't let go

You're inside my head
Inside my head

What do you want from me now you got me
Now my energy you suck from me
And I'm holding on for dear life
Quit smothering me
Quit laughing at me
I've got a disease, an english disease
It will not go
It will not go

You're inside my head
Inside my head

Whatever you put in that syringe
Whatever you really said to him
He's sitting there inside of me
And you bother me, you possess me
You're there again, ahead of me
I won't let go
I won't let go

You're inside my head
Inside my head
Inside my head
Inside my head
Too hard on the brakes again
What if these brakes just give in
What if they don't get out of the way
What if there's someone overtaking
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
There could be an idiot on the road
The only kick in life is pumping his steel

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive...

Don't die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldn't cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say
I'm going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
What if the car loses control
What if there's someone overtaking

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
They won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive killer cars

Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
No they won't ever take me alive
'Cause they all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars
I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my eyes
I'm not coming back

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth

If you'd been a dog
They would've drowned you at birth

Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

So knives out
Cook him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot

I want you to know
He's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my eyes
I'm not coming back

So knives out
Catch the mouse
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth

If you'd been a dog
They would've drowned you at birth

Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

So knives out
Cook him up
Squash his head

Squash his head
Put him in the pot
Once again, she is smashing up her house again
She is throwing things through windows
She is mad at someone else again,
It is now a broken home

Once again, I am so low with my only friend
He is smashing up his house again
You are throwing things at me again
And I'm wrecked up all inside

Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Well if I stop that singing to you friend
Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Someone is standing there

There I'm home, once the feet inside shout it out
Once a beating when I make my way out
Once a beating when I'm home inside
There is nothing wrong at all

Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Well if I stop that singing to you friend
Well if I stop that singing now and shout
Someone is standing there
Why do we play these foolish games
Only consolations
You feed me to the lions
I didn't need at all

And this just feels like spinning plates
I'm living in cloud cuckoo land
And this just feels like spinning plates
My body is floating down the muddy river
You stop the crowd
I cried out to break the spell
You wake and smile
I just snapped and lost control

Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
The stress and the tension
I'm in a lull

There's nothing so dull
As talking, talking 'bout yourself
But what I meant to say
I'm sorry that I lost control

Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
Crawling through the keyhole
I'm in a lull
Here it comes, here it comes
I can feel the hills exploding
Exploding gracefully
Burning up the freeway
Here it comes

Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful kids into beautiful trouble
Well it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn

Fast Toyota, burns rubber
Useless rockers from England
Good times had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your conscience

Blue and white birds stepping hard on the pedal,
Interstate Five runs straight down the middle
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn
Don't forget that you are our son
Now go back to bed

We just know that you are ours
You won't cry too hard

Death to all who stand in your way
Wave my arms you
Was always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
And take a holiday..

Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no-one's listening anyway
Just trying to bribe me..

And if it's alright, then what am I doing here
And if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
And if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man

Today I wrote a bad cheque
Packed a bag and took a jet
But no-one's looking anyway
I hope they miss me

I just think maybe I'm making a mistake.
Shake hands, genocide, molasses
Jet powered caravans, molasses
I'm too good, you're stuck on
Rent free earthquake zone, molasses

I need someone else's glasses
Starving waitresses in plasters
Fat houseflies, genocide
We've been stitched up, molasses
After years of waiting nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize

I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case [x2]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case

After years of waiting
After years of waiting nothing came
And you realize you're looking,
Looking in the wrong place

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case [x2]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case [x2]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case [x3]

After years of waiting
You're a reasonable man
Get off our case [x3]
I'm a reasonable man,
Get off my case [x3]

I'm a reasonable man,
Get off my case [x3]
I'm a reasonable man,
Get off my case [x3]
In a city of the future
It is difficult to concentrate
Meet the boss, meet the wife
Everybody's happy
Everyone is made for life

In a city of the future
It is difficult to find a space
I'm too busy to see you
You're too busy to wait

But I'm okay, how are you
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
But I'm okay, how are you
I hope you're okay too

Everyone one of those days
When the sky's California blue
With a beautiful bombshell
I throw myself into my work
I'm too lazy, I've been kidding myself for so long

I'm okay, how are you
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
But I'm okay, how are you
I hope you're okay too
How'd you get your teeth so pearly
Dew drop dentures
White washed faces
She runs from the third world, pearly

Vanilla (feel it crawl to me)
Milkshakes (crawl back again)
From Hard Rock (whatever you say)
Cafes (it won't go away)
That's where (I feel it crawl to me)
She got her (crawls back again)
Sweet tooth (it won't go away)
For white boys (whatever you say)

She runs from the third world, pearly
Hurts me

Darling hurts me

And I miss your glow as I unsettle

Oh and I'll always feel Oh but I'll always feel   
I will always be  I will always feel   
Right, One, Two, Three, Four

So sad you seem tired 
So sell your sin inside 
So sad your sitting tight. 
And come and live with me 
Well come and live with me

Oh no, pop is dead, long live pop
It died an ugly death by back-catalogue
And now you know it gets you nowhere
And now you know, you realize

Oh no, pop is dead, it just gave up
We raised the dead but they won't stand up
And radio has salmonella
And now you know you're gonna die

He left this message for us

So what pop is dead, it's no great loss
So many facelifts, his face flew off
The emperor really has no clothes on
And his skin is peeling off

Oh no, pop is dead, long live pop,
One final line of coke to jack him off
Jack him off

He left this message for us
He left this message for us

He's dead, He's dead, Pop is dead
He's dead, He's dead, Pop is dead
He's dead, He's dead, Pop is dead
There are barn doors
And there are revolving doors

Doors on the rudders of big ships
We are revolving doors

There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors
And there are secret doors

There are doors that lock
And doors that don't

There are doors that let you in
And out
But never open
But they are trapdoors
That you can't come back from

I jumped in the river and what did I see
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
All the things I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

It's funny how
To drive your stupid car
It's funny how
'Cause I never get that far
And you put my brain in overload
And i can't change gears
I cannot see the road

You got concrete eyes
And I cannot see your face
And I failed in life
'Cause you crushed me with your hands
And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gears
I cannot see the road
I want to, I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon the surface for
The birds, the birds, the birds

You want me, well fucking well come and find me
I'll be waiting with a gun and a pack of sandwiches
And nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

You want me, well, come on and break the door down
You want me, fucking come on and break the door down
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready...
Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Holy roman empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us all on
You can take us all on

You and whose army
You and your cronies

You forget so easily
You ought to know

Oh so sad

I'm so sad

Are you such a dreamer 
To put the world to rights
I'll stay home forever 
Where two and two always makes a five
I'll lay down the tracks 
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers 
And two and two always makes a five 
It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout 
It is too late now
Because you're not there 
Payin' attention 
Payin' attention 
Payin' attention 
Payin' attention

But the music's all wrong
Cos I'm not

Back and hide
But I'm not
Oh hail to the thief
Oh hail to the thief
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in the box
Cos I'm not
Cos I'm not
Oh go up to the king, and the sky is falling in
But it's not
But it's not
Maybe not
Maybe not
No [x42]
I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you.
(By the way) I was there and it wasn't like that.
You've come here just to start a fight
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding
Yeah
Hypocrite opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round you stay frozen to the spot
You had the pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding yeah
Oh no no
Drag him out your window 
Dragging out your dead 
Singing I miss you 
Snakes and ladders 
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker 
Smacks you in the head 
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth 
Steel toe caps 
Takes all your credit cards
Get up get the gunge
Get the eggs 
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face

Dance you fucker dance you fucker
Don't you dare

Take it with the love is given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back let me back

Don't look in the mirror 
At the face you don't recognize
Help me call the doctor
Put me inside
Put me inside 
Put me inside 
Put me inside 
Put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone 
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children 
If I don't pay the ransom
But I'll never see him again
If I squeal to the cops
No no no no no no no:
Walking like giant cranes ah
With my x ray eyes i strip you naked 
In a tight little world and why are you on the list?
Stepford wives who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and sunday papers.
City boys in first class
Don't know we're born little
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone else always does always pick it up
Get over get up get over
Turn the tape off.
I keep the wolf from the door 
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone 
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up

We're rotten fruit
We're damaged goods
What the hell we've got nothing more to lose
One burst and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifting
This far but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on a breaker
Honey sweets so fall asleep
I'm backsliding
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking
Oh oh oh
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
You fell into our
You fell into a

One burst and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters
Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body 
Someone saw someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I ended up sucked in
Over my dead body
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me
We don't really want a monster taking over
Tip toeing, tying down
We don't want the loonies takin' over
Tip toeing, tying down our arms
May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash over me
I will
Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants
Sitting ducks
I will

The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now
I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down real neat 
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited fucked up
Strangled beaten up
Used in a photo in time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in devon
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why
I feel
So skinned alive.
My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
Yeah no one likes a smart ass but we all like stars
But that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up
Strangled beaten up
I got myxomatosis 
I got myxomatosis
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied
I sail to the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost
I was dropped from
The moonbeam
And sailed on shooting stars

Maybe you'll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
You'll build an Ark

And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rattlin' on my window sill
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain
Any fool can easy pick a hole I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut
Scatterbrain

Broken branches trip me as I speak

Just cos you feel it doesn't mean it's there
There's always a siren singing you to shipwreck (don't reach out, don't reach out [x2])
Stay away from these rocks we'd be a walking disaster (don't reach out, don't reach out [x2])

And lonely [x3]

Waiting to happen
Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?
We want the young blood (la [x8])
Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Fleabitten motheaten?
We suck young blood (la [x8])
We suck young blood (la [x8])
Woah woah

How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string

How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
I won't take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string

You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue?
Did your string come undone?

One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow

You used to be alright
What happened
Et cetera, et cetera
Facts for whatever
Fifteen steps
Then a sheer drop

How come I end up where I started?
How can I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out and you cut the string
This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around

Hiding from the bombers
Wading through the fields
Running in the half light

Running to ??
Just like everybody
Could ??

Running through the underground
And this is your warning
4 minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna grow old
I just wanna run and hide

Now I'm in a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

This is your warning
4 minute warning
I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings

I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car

I am all the days
That you choose to ignore

You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

I'm a moth
Who just wants to share your light

I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night

I only stick with you
Because there are no others

You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle your picture
Lying in the reeds

It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
I've got the poison, poison, poison now
I'm standing in the hall
Kicking out the wall
It's all been said to comfort you

Bangers in the mash
People lose for cash
??

Whatever turns you on
Whatever gets you off
Chief of police, the vice-chancellor 
??
You're dancing to my little red book 

Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
I've got the poison, poison
And I want more
Get you an armoured car
They're gonna throw a rock
Stare into the light
The pyramid is power
If you are on the top
??
If you stare into the dark,
The dark will stare back
Back into your soul 

I want to thank you, thank you, thank you all
I'm having such a good time, a good time, had enough?

I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down when I go down 
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall
Kicking out the wall
Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
I've got the poison
I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong

Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no

I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out

Make a sound
Move back home
A pale imitation
With the edges sawn off

I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves everywhere

Has the light gone out for you?
Cause the light's gone out for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
You can fight it like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got scared and they put me in
They got scared and they put me in
All their eyes wrapped around my face
All their eyes wrapped around my face
Although everybody else can see
Although everybody else can see

I'm alive

I've seen it coming
Get yourself together
Let the light pour in 
Pour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without a warning
Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup
Down is the new up, is the new up

Your services are not required
Your future's bleak, you're so last week

Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flopped?
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Down is the new up, is the new up

You're on Candid Camera
The chink in your armor
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on, pass it down
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town
Wakey wakey
Rise and shine
It's on again off again on again
Watch me fall
Like dominoes
In pretty patterns

Fingers in
You're backward, lying
I'm tingling tingling tingling
It's what you feel now
What you ought to what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible

Dead from the neck up
Because I'm stuck stuck stuck
We thought you had it in you
But no no no
For no real reason

Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
And take a bow take a bow take a bow
It's what you feel now
What you ought to what you ought to
An elephant that's in the room is
Tumbling tumbling tumbling
In duplicate and triplicate and
Plastic bags and
Duplicate and triplicate

Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuck stuck stuck
We thought you had it in you
But no no no
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough is enough is enough
I love you but enough is enough, enough
And I'm stuck
There's no real reason

In a fit
A fit
You're melting in to butter
Over here
Come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient
Patiently
I didn't
But now I can see

That there's a way out
That there's a way out

That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
I don't wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts

Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine

Fall off the table,
And get swept under
Denial, denial

The infrastructure will collapse
From carpet spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'good night'

Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine

Fall off the table,
And get swept under

Denial, denial
Denial, denial

Your ears are burning
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad mood disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again

The walls abandon shape
They've got a cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
What's the point of instruments
Words are a sawed off shotgun

Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out

Before you run away from me
Before you start unravelling
Before you take my mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance

Jigsaws falling into place
There is nothing to explain
Regard each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once
Not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
Jigsaws falling into place
Appliances have gone berserk
I can't look you up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little fools

And I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses live and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe...

And if I don't know ??
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

Cause I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses live and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe...

It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Too bright
Too powerful

Too much
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing

Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails

So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
Reckoner
You can't take it with you
Does it for the pleasure

You were not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak his name
Dedicated to all you
All your needs

Because we separate
The ripples on a black shore
Because we separate
The ripples on a black shore

Reckoner

Dedicated to all you human beings
I'm stuck in the tardis 
Trapped in hyperspace 
One minute snake charming
The next in another place

All the right moves and 
Earn the right percent
Watch me dance like a puppet 
You can almost see the strings

Give me an answer
Give me a sign 
I've been climbing up this ladder 
I've been wasting my time

So long, so long
So long, so long 

Up on the ladder 
No time to escape
Up on the ladder
Away for fucking sake

Up on the ladder
Try to call out your name
Up on the ladder
You're all the fucking same

Oh, you let the people down
You let the people down
You let the people down
When I'm at the pearly gates
This'll be on my videotape
My videotape
My videotape

When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me

This is one for the good days
And I have it all here
In red blue green
In red blue green

You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape [x6]

This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
So I'm talking to you before it's too late

No matter what happens now
I shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen.
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me

Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?

I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me

Turn me on to phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth
And fall off
Everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance

I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

Yeah I
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
And I
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape

How can I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out and you cut the string
Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of fear is thicker than you think
Don't do it, don't jump

Changed shape to fit, in the end you just feel sick
A million love songs under anaesthetic
Hey don't do it, don't jump

Lewis, save yourself the pain, you'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain, it never really mattered

We never noticed, we never understood
He just get crushed to fit, he never even smelt out the best
It's the best, it's the best day of your life

Lewis, save yourself the pain, you'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain, it never really matters

No, I swear, I swear, I swear
Oh, mistreated, a low corporate
Mistreated, a low corporate

I don't wanna to talk about it
I don't wanna to talk about it
I don't wanna to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I don't wanna to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I wrapped you inside my coat
When they came to firebomb the house
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no one can touch me
Now that I'm held in your spell

A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl can turn your world into dust

Sell me a car that goes
Sell me a house that stands
I never cared before, I never cared before
I never cared before, before, before, before

A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl can turn your world into dust

A beautiful girl
A beautiful girl can turn your world into dust

I stood in front of her face
When the first bullet was shot
I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I don't have a choice

Anywhere I go
You are always there
Outside the car
Or in my hair

I think I've been here before
Yes I've been here before
The last time you locked
All the doors

And I resent you calling
I resent your voice
I resent that I don't have a choice

And yes I am wary
Yes I am..

I think I've told you once
I think I needed advice
You were such a help
That's very nice

I think I've been here before
Yes I've been here before
But this time I kick
Down your door

And yes I am wary
Yes I am wary
